1. Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. It involves a structured approach to the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), from gathering requirements to deployment and maintenance, ensuring that the software is reliable, efficient, and meets the users' needs.

Traditional Programming focuses primarily on coding and the implementation of algorithms. It is usually a small-scale activity where a single programmer or a small team writes code to solve a specific problem without necessarily considering the broader context of the software's lifecycle.

Differences:

Scope: Software engineering covers the entire lifecycle of software development, while traditional programming focuses mainly on coding.
Processes: Software engineering involves structured processes, methodologies, and tools for analysis, design, testing, and maintenance. Traditional programming often lacks these formal processes.
Team Collaboration: Software engineering typically involves larger teams and collaboration among various stakeholders (e.g., developers, testers, project managers, clients). Traditional programming may be done individually or in small teams with less formal communication.
Quality Assurance: Software engineering emphasizes quality assurance through various testing methods and standards. Traditional programming may not incorporate rigorous testing and quality control.

5. Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is the design principle of dividing a software system into distinct, independent components (modules) that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality of the system.

Benefits:

Maintainability: Easier to update and fix individual modules without affecting the entire system.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects, saving development time and effort.
Scalability: Facilitates scaling by allowing individual modules to be updated or replaced without disrupting the whole system.
Parallel Development: Enables different teams to work on separate modules simultaneously, speeding up development.
6. Testing in Software Engineering:
